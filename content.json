This in turn, entails the architects having to make 3D models themselves or having to ask people to make 3D models for them.<br><br>The manual 3D modelling usually takes up about 1-2 hours of the architects time. The solution cuts down on the time required from prep from 1-2 hours down to 5-10 minutes and automates most of the 3D generation.<br><br>The user imports the 2D floor plan from a simple .exe and then in turn receive a complete 3D model that is viewable in VR right out the gate with proper materials/textures assigned to it. Uses Python as the backend to parse the CAD files and then uses Unreal to swap in models/textures/material from a huge library of presets.",
